## 1st Workshop on Computational Approaches to Discourse

location: tba
date: tba


The last five years have seen a dramatic improvement in the ability of NLP systems to understand and produce words and sentences. This development has created a renewed interest in discourse problems as researchers move towards the processing of long-form text and conversations. There is a surge of activity in discourse parsing, coherence models, text summarization, corpora for discourse level reading comprehension, and discourse related/aided representation learning, to name a few.  [if possible, give some citations?] At this juncture, we envision that a workshop that brings together discourse experts and upcoming researchers will catalyze the speed and knowledge needed to solve such problems, as well as serve as a forum for the discussion of suitable datasets and reliable evaluation methods. 

The previous workshops on discourse in machine translation (DiscoMT), linking lexical, sentential and discourse semantics (LSDSem), discourse structure in natural language generation (DSNNLG), discourse parsing and treebanking (DisRPT) and coreference (CORBON/CRAC), have shown that there is considerable interest and success in bringing together the community working on specific problems. We believe that the discourse community will also benefit from a general place forum where work ranging from corpus development/analysis to computational models, and evaluation is discussed, and desiderata can be drawn for future progress. 

The Workshop on Computational Approaches to Discourse brings together researchers interested in all aspects of discourse and its computational modeling. We welcome symbolic and probabilistic approaches, corpus development and analysis, as well as machine and deep learning approaches to discourse. We appreciate theoretical contributions as well as practical applications, including demos of systems and tools. The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for the community of NLP researchers working on all aspects of discourse. 

### Organizers

Chloé Braud, Researcher at CNRS - LORIA (Nancy, France), chloe.braud@loria.fr. Her work focuses on discourse parsing, with a specific interest on weakly supervised settings, and cross-lingual and cross-domain learning. She was co-chair for the workshop WiNLP 2017, App chair for EMNLP 2017 and she’s organizing the French NLP conference JEP-TALN-RECITAL 2020.

Christian Hardmeier, Senior Researcher at the University of Edinburgh and Uppsala University, christian.hardmeier@lingfil.uu.se. Christian Hardmeier studies the use, interpretation and translation of referring expressions such as pronouns across languages with a view, on the one hand, to improving machine translation and, on the other hand, to improving automatic discourse processing by exploiting multilingual data. He has helped to organise several workshops at ACL/EMNLP (DiscoMT 2015, S2MT 2015, GeBNLP 2019, DiscoMT 2019) and shared tasks (DiscoMT 2015, WMT 2016, DiscoMT 2017, GeBNLP 2019) and served as area chair at ACL 2019.

Jessy Li, Assistant Professor in the Linguistics department at the University of Texas at Austin, jessy@austin.utexas.edu. Her interests are in computational discourse and pragmatics, as well as social implications of language use. She also develops NLP techniques under domain shift. She is a board member of SIGDIAL, and was an area co-chair for Discourse and Pragmatics at NAACL 2018.

Annie Louis, Research Scientist at Google AI (London). She develops computational models of documents and conversations, and uses these to aid different applications. She is particularly interested in methods which can learn from minimal annotation, and can be transferred across domains. She is currently on the advisory board of SIGDIAL, and was the program co-chair for the SIGDIAL conference in 2017. She was co-chair for the LSDSem workshops at EMNLP 2015 and EACL 2017, and also the Uphill Battles in NLP workshop at EMNLP 2016. She is also an associate editor of the Discourse and Dialogue journal.  

Michael Strube, NLP Group Leader at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (Heidelberg, Germany), michael.strube@h-its.org. Michael Strube is interested in questions related to processing, understanding and generating discourse. He works on coreference resolution with a particular focus on appropriate representations for the task. He develops models of local coherence based on graphs and/or neural networks with applications in text generation, assessing readability, essay scoring and automatic summarization. He was PC co-chair for ACL-IJCNLP 2015, PC and general co-chair for SIGdial 2004 and 2013, PC co-chair for the two ACL workshops on ethics in NLP in 2017 and 2018, area chair for numerous *ACL conferences, tutorial co-chair for ACL 2012, IJCNLP 2017, NAACL 2019, and associate editor for the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.
